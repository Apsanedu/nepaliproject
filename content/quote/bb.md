This one is about Nepali movies.

1. Mantra movie

Watched this movie online. I am not sure what is the name of the real name of the movie. Somebody reuploaded this video from OSR Digital channel and added superstars name in the title.
The movie has many clever dialogues, the character concept is good but the execution is not so good. Three friends and a messenger boy explore love. The three boys are in a love triangle with two girls. The story is good, fun and clever until the intermission. Like the Bollywood movies, this one fails terribly to conclude the story. Bollywood movies usually have a bad revealtion like a character playing with another to "test" his real behavior or a character dies for no reason. Everything falls apart in the second half of most of these movies.

2. Kaha Bhetiela

Biraj Bhatta is coming back to Nepali cinema with a gangster story.
